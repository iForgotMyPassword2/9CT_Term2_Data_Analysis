# Activities C: 1

1. How many columns are in the dataset?
- There are 15 columns located in the csv file.

2. Name three of them and explain what they represent
- 'Name' is the dataset that gives the value of an individual's name, the 'sex' column gives their sex as either Male or Female, 'Sport' is the sport that they competed in
and the 'City' is the city in which the olympics were held. Finally, 'weight' is the column that determines the olympic athlete's weight

3. What do the first five rows show?
- The first five rows show different athletes and their general information like their physical characteristics, sport and country.


# Activities C: 2
1. what are the top five sports?
- Athletics, Gymnastics, Swimming, shooting and cycling.
2. How many male vs female athletes?
- Male: 196594
- Female: 74522
Therefore there were more men then women.


# Activities C: 3
1. what was the average age?
- The average age was 25.56 years old
2. What is the oldest and youngest athlete?
- Oldest: 97 years old
- youngest: 10 years old
3. Are there any columns with missing or strange values?
- The age of 10 years old and the weight of just 25 kilos is strange.

# Activities Filtering, sorting and grouping
1. What do these filters do?
- The filters show two different conditions. One is that the computer filters out all files that are not females, leaving the output as just female athletes/.
The second filter is designed to only display female athletes over the age of 35.
2. As shown using the len() function, there are 74522 female athletes, with 16384 athletes over the age of 35.


# Task 3: Sorting data
1. The sport with the most number of women is Athletics, followed by Gymnastics and swimming. This is likely due to the popularity in general of the sports


# More sorting Activities
Reflection Journal:
1. The easiest filtering task for me was the one that involved Australian swimmers, as I could follow closely what other activities told me to do without requiring any additional
programming knowledge, and just depending on my understanding of other code given to me.

2. The most difficult sorting task was likely the sport by female athletes task, which required some additional research on the pandas programming syntax. This was because I was unsure how to combine the conditions sport and sex. I utilised copilot to help me with this.

3. It was surprising to me that the average weight when playing Tug Of War was 95 kilograms, although this does make sense since a lot of weight is required to be able to realistically tug harder than others.

4. Some real world questions that could be answered through this include Flight data, Weight comparisons and general rankings with things.
This is really useful for the world showing how important data science is, and how simple code is capable of creating ranking systems, filtering systems and sorting systems.

# Dataframe Activities:
1. These operations are key to organising and working with data and information as they allow you to format the text given. This is because putting in a csv file automatically altes the format to become far easier to work with. After that, creating a function that can read the csv file allows the printed text to come out formatted and organised. Additionally, the use of a csv file allows us to manipulate the information using filters and groups to organise and work with data that could otherwise be too hard to understand.
